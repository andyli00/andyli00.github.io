      <p class="w3-text-grey">My name is Andy and Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph. During the summer of 2023 I worked as a co-op program developer at Domco Group of Canada. This website is a summary and reflection on my time there.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">About Domco</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Domco is a leading provider of remote site services including catering, housekeeping, facility maintenance, and camp management with over 70 years of experience. 
        This doesn't directly relate to computer science, but they had a program that needed to be developed and that was my main task.

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Goals</h5>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">Going into the placement, I knew it would be a new experience as instead of joining an existing software development team like my previous coop, I'd be communicating directly with a "client"
      (my employer) to develop a program that satisfies their needs. I knew I would need to gather requirements and translate them to code. So my main goals were to continously improve my communication skills and my ability to 
      translate requirements into code.

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">My Experience</h5>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">
      The main project I worked on was a program to help automate the analysis of various reports to help Domco understand their expenses and other statistics.
      The core of the problem was to perform various calculations on data and then move it between Excel sheets. I had experience in a previous course with the Python pandas library for data manipulation 
      and analysis, so I decided to write the program using that. 
      <br>
      I split development into a few stages, making incremental progress and sharing it to discuss and ask for feedback. The first stage was simply performing all the calculations
      and verifying that they were correct. The second was moving the data, which ended up being trickier than expected because they had to be in a different order.
      <br>
      Along the way there were various small things that came up in development, and either I would make a suggestion to my supervisor on how to handle it or we would discuss a solution. Overall I 
      feel that my technical communication significantly improved by discussing the program with someone who isn't a programmer.

    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Conclusion</h5>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">My co-op at Docmo was an extremely valuable experience software development. I learned how to handle the development of a program mostly independently, and 
      improved my technical communication.
